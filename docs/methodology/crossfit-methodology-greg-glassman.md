# CrossFit Methodology (Greg Glassman)

## Overview

CrossFit is a comprehensive fitness methodology created by Greg Glassman that defines fitness as increased work capacity across broad time and modal domains. The system combines elements of Olympic weightlifting, gymnastics, and metabolic conditioning to create constantly varied, high-intensity, functional movement workouts designed to optimize physical competence across ten fitness domains: cardiovascular endurance, stamina, strength, flexibility, power, speed, coordination, agility, balance, and accuracy.

The methodology revolutionized fitness by emphasizing measurable, observable, and repeatable results through functional movements performed at high intensity. CrossFit prepares individuals for any physical challenge, whether known or unknown, making it applicable across military, law enforcement, firefighting, competitive athletics, and general population fitness. The system's scalability allows the same workout to challenge both elite athletes and beginners through appropriate modifications.

## Creator/Origin

Greg Glassman developed CrossFit in the 1990s, drawing from his background as a gymnast and personal trainer who questioned traditional fitness approaches. His revolutionary insight was that fitness could be systematically defined and measured through work capacity across broad time and modal domains. Glassman founded CrossFit Inc. in 2000 and created the affiliate model that spread the methodology worldwide.

The system was refined through practical application with diverse populations, from Navy SEALs to suburban soccer moms. Glassman's approach emphasized that elite fitness was not exclusive to athletes but achievable by anyone willing to train with intensity and consistency. His definition of fitness and systematic approach to programming became the foundation for one of the most influential fitness movements of the 21st century.

## Key Principles

1. **Constantly Varied Programming**: Avoiding routine and predictable patterns to prevent adaptation plateaus and maintain broad fitness development across all domains.

2. **High-Intensity Training**: Working at high percentages of maximum effort to drive rapid physiological adaptation and maximize training efficiency.

3. **Functional Movement Patterns**: Emphasizing natural, multi-joint movements that translate directly to real-world activities and athletic performance.

4. **Measurable and Observable Results**: Tracking performance through objective metrics, benchmark workouts, and quantifiable improvements.

5. **Universal Scalability**: Adapting workouts to any fitness level while maintaining the intended stimulus and training effect.

6. **Community-Driven Environment**: Creating supportive group training environments that foster motivation, accountability, and camaraderie.

7. **Broad Physical Adaptation**: Developing competence across multiple fitness domains rather than specializing in any single area.

8. **Work Capacity Focus**: Increasing the ability to perform more work in less time or sustain work across different time domains.

## Programming Structure

### Core Training Modalities

**Olympic Weightlifting (25%)**:
- Clean & Jerk, Snatch, and their variations
- Develops power, coordination, and full-body strength
- Emphasizes explosive hip extension and overhead stability

**Gymnastics (25%)**:
- Bodyweight movements: pull-ups, push-ups, handstand push-ups, muscle-ups
- Develops relative strength, coordination, and body awareness
- Includes static holds and dynamic movements

**Metabolic Conditioning (50%)**:
- Monostructural: running, rowing, cycling, swimming
- Mixed-modal: combining lifting and cardio elements
- Develops cardiovascular capacity and stamina

### Workout Formats

**AMRAP (As Many Rounds/Reps As Possible)**:
- Fixed time limit with maximum work output
- Develops work capacity and mental toughness
- Example: 20-minute AMRAP of 5 pull-ups, 10 push-ups, 15 squats

**For Time**:
- Complete prescribed work as quickly as possible
- Develops speed and anaerobic capacity
- Example: 21-15-9 reps of thrusters and pull-ups

**EMOM (Every Minute On the Minute)**:
- Specific work performed at the start of each minute
- Develops power endurance and pacing
- Example: 10 minutes of 5 deadlifts at 70% 1RM

**Tabata Protocol**:
- 20 seconds maximum effort, 10 seconds rest for 8 rounds
