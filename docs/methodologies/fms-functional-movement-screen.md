# FMS (Functional Movement Screen)

## Overview

The Functional Movement Screen (FMS) is a comprehensive assessment and corrective methodology developed by Gray Cook and Lee Burton that systematically identifies movement dysfunctions, asymmetries, and limitations that may predispose individuals to injury or limit performance. This evidence-based system emphasizes movement quality over quantity, providing a standardized approach to screen, assess, and improve fundamental movement patterns that form the foundation of all human movement.

The FMS consists of seven fundamental movement patterns that require mobility, stability, and neuromuscular control. Each pattern is scored on a 0-3 scale, with specific criteria for each score. The system is designed to identify the weakest link in movement patterns and provide targeted corrective strategies to address dysfunctions before they lead to compensation, pain, or injury.

## Creator/Origin

Gray Cook, a physical therapist and orthopedic manual therapist, developed the FMS in collaboration with Lee Burton and other movement professionals in the 1990s. Cook's background in orthopedic and sports physical therapy, combined with his extensive work with athletes and active populations, led him to recognize the need for a systematic movement assessment tool that could predict injury risk and guide corrective interventions.

The system was refined through years of clinical practice and research, drawing from developmental kinesiology, orthopedic assessment principles, and movement science. Cook's philosophy centers on the concept that movement quality is the foundation of all physical performance and that addressing movement dysfunctions proactively can prevent injuries and enhance performance across all populations and activities.

## Key Principles

1. **Movement Quality Over Quantity**: Emphasizing the importance of how movement is performed rather than how much work is accomplished, recognizing that poor movement patterns lead to compensation and injury.

2. **Systematic Assessment Protocol**: Using standardized tests and scoring criteria to objectively evaluate movement quality and identify dysfunctions in a reproducible manner.

3. **Corrective Exercise Hierarchy**: Addressing movement dysfunctions through a systematic progression from mobility to stability to motor control, ensuring proper movement pattern restoration.

4. **Individual Movement Assessment**: Recognizing that each person has unique movement patterns and dysfunctions that require personalized corrective strategies.

5. **Injury Prevention Focus**: Identifying and addressing movement risk factors before they lead to injury, emphasizing proactive rather than reactive approaches.

6. **Movement Pattern Foundation**: Establishing quality fundamental movement patterns as the prerequisite for all advanced training and performance activities.

7. **Professional Integration**: Providing a common language and assessment tool for movement professionals across disciplines to communicate and collaborate effectively.

## Programming Structure

### The Seven Fundamental Movement Patterns

**1. Deep Squat**
- **Purpose**: Assesses bilateral, symmetrical mobility of hips, knees, and ankles, as well as bilateral, symmetrical stability of the core and shoulders
- **Scoring**: 3 = Upper torso parallel to tibia, femur below horizontal, knees aligned over feet; 2 = Same as 3 but with heels elevated; 1 = Unable to perform with heels elevated; 0 = Pain during movement
- **Common Dysfunctions**: Ankle dorsiflexion limitation, hip flexion restriction, thoracic spine extension limitation, shoulder flexion restriction

**2. Hurdle Step**
- **Purpose**: Assesses bilateral functional mobility and stability of hips, knees, and ankles, as well as dynamic balance
- **Scoring**: 3 = Hips, knees, and ankles remain aligned in sagittal plane, minimal movement of lumbar spine, hurdle leg clears hurdle; 2 = Same as 3 but with some imbalance; 1 = Contact with hurdle or loss of balance; 0 = Pain during movement
- **Common Dysfunctions**: Hip flexor tightness, ankle dorsiflexion limitation, poor single-leg stability, hip abductor weakness

**3. In-Line Lunge**
- **Purpose**: Assesses hip, knee, ankle, and foot mobility and stability, as well as quadriceps flexibility and knee stability
- **Scoring**: 3 = Knee touches board behind heel, dowel contacts back of head, upper torso, and sacrum; 2 = Same as 3 but with some imbalance; 1 = Unable to maintain position or dowel contact; 0 = Pain during movement
- **Common Dysfunctions**: Ankle dorsiflexion limitation, hip flexor tightness, poor ankle stability, thoracic spine mobility restriction

**4. Shoulder Mobility**
- **Purpose**: Assesses bilateral shoulder range of motion, combining internal rotation, adduction, and extension with external rotation, abduction, and flexion
- **Scoring**: 3 = Fists within one hand length; 2 = Fists within 1.5 hand lengths; 1 = Fists greater than 1.5 hand lengths apart; 0 = Pain during movement
- **Common Dysfunctions**: Shoulder internal rotation limitation, latissimus dorsi tightness, posterior capsule tightness, thoracic spine extension limitation

**5. Active Straight-Leg Raise**
- **Purpose**: Assesses active hamstring and gastroc-soleus flexibility while maintaining a stable pelvis and active extension of the opposite leg
- **Scoring**: 3 = Vertical line between ankle and mid-thigh; 2 = Vertical line between mid-thigh and ASIS; 1 = Vertical line below ASIS; 0 = Pain during movement
- **Common Dysfunctions**: Hamstring inflexibility, hip flexor tightness, poor core stability, sciatic nerve tension

**6. Trunk Stability Push-Up**
- **Purpose**: Assesses the ability to stabilize the spine in an anterior-posterior plane during a closed-chain upper body movement
- **Scoring**: 3 = Males perform from toes, females from knees, body lifts as unit; 2 = Males from knees, females with hands elevated; 1 = Unable to perform one repetition; 0 = Pain during movement
- **Common Dysfunctions**: Poor core stability, weak shoulder girdle, inadequate hip stability, poor neuromuscular control

**7. Rotary Stability**
- **Purpose**: Assesses multi-planar pelvic, core, and shoulder girdle stability during a combined upper and lower extremity movement
- **Scoring**: 3 = Performs correctly unilaterally; 2 = Performs correctly bilaterally; 1 = Unable to perform; 0 = Pain during movement
