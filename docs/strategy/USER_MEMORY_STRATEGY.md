# User Memory Strategy - Persistent Coaching Context

## Overview

The User Memory feature enables AI coaches to persistently remember user preferences, goals, constraints, and instructions across coaching sessions. This creates a more personalized and continuous coaching experience by allowing users to explicitly tell their AI coach what to remember for future conversations.

## Architecture Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Explicit User Control**: Users explicitly request what should be remembered via natural language
- **AI-Driven Detection**: Bedrock Nova Micro model detects memory requests with confidence scoring
- **Seamless Integration**: Memories are automatically included in coach conversation prompts
- **Non-Intrusive Operation**: Memory operations never interrupt the coaching conversation flow
- **Privacy-Focused**: Users control what is remembered and can see their stored memories

### Design Goals
1. **Natural Interaction**: Users say "remember that I..." and the AI handles the rest
2. **High Precision**: Conservative detection (70% confidence threshold) to avoid false positives
3. **Contextual Awareness**: Memories are organized by type and importance for better AI usage
4. **Performance Optimized**: Background operations don't slow down conversations
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Pattern follows existing DynamoDB and conversation structures

## Implementation Architecture

### Components Overview

```
User Input → Memory Detection → Storage → Retrieval → Prompt Integration → AI Response
     ↓              ↓              ↓          ↓               ↓                ↓
Natural Lang. → Bedrock API → DynamoDB → Query Existing → System Prompt → Enhanced Response
```

### 1. Detection Component
**File**: `amplify/functions/libs/coach-conversation/detection.ts`
**Function**: `detectUserMemoryRequest()`

- **Model**: Amazon Bedrock Nova Micro (cost-optimized for classification tasks)
- **Input**: User message + conversation context (last 3 messages)
- **Output**: Confidence score + extracted memory content with metadata
- **Threshold**: 70% confidence minimum for memory creation
- **Processing Time**: ~200-500ms per detection

**Memory Request Indicators**:
- "I want you to remember..."
- "Please remember that..."
- "Don't forget that I..."
- "Keep in mind that..."
- "For future reference..."

### 2. Storage Component
**File**: `amplify/dynamodb/operations.ts`
**Functions**: `saveUserMemory()`, `queryUserMemories()`, `updateUserMemory()`

**Storage Pattern**:
- **Primary Key**: `user#${userId}`
- **Sort Key**: `userMemory#${memoryId}`
- **Entity Type**: `userMemory`

**Memory Types**:
- **preference**: Training preferences, communication style
- **goal**: Fitness goals, targets, aspirations
- **constraint**: Physical limitations, time constraints, equipment
- **instruction**: Specific coaching instructions or approaches
- **context**: Personal context, background, lifestyle factors

### 3. Integration Component
**File**: `amplify/functions/libs/coach-conversation/prompt-generation.ts`
**Function**: `generateUserMemoriesSection()`

**Prompt Placement**: Section 5.5 (between detailed user background and user context)
**Organization**: Memories grouped by type with usage statistics
**AI Instructions**: Clear guidance on how to use memories naturally

### 4. Usage Tracking
- **Statistics**: Usage count, last used date, creation date
- **Background Updates**: Non-blocking usage tracking during conversations
- **Prioritization**: High importance + frequently used memories surface first

## Data Schema

### UserMemory Record Structure
```typescript
interface UserMemory {
  memoryId: string;           // Unique identifier
  userId: string;             // User who owns the memory
  coachId?: string;           // Optional: coach-specific memories
  content: string;            // What to remember
  memoryType: 'preference' | 'goal' | 'constraint' | 'instruction' | 'context';
  metadata: {
    createdAt: Date;          // When memory was created
    lastUsed?: Date;          // Last time used in conversation
    usageCount: number;       // How often referenced
    source: 'explicit_request'; // How memory was created
    importance: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low'; // AI-determined importance
    tags?: string[];          // Optional categorization tags
  };
}
```

### DynamoDB Storage Pattern
```json
{
  "pk": "user#user123",
  "sk": "userMemory#user_memory_1703123456789_abc123def",
  "entityType": "userMemory",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "attributes": {
    "memoryId": "user_memory_1703123456789_abc123def",
    "userId": "user123",
    "coachId": "coach456",
    "content": "I prefer morning workouts and like compound movements",
    "memoryType": "preference",
    "metadata": {
      "createdAt": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "usageCount": 3,
      "source": "explicit_request",
      "importance": "high",
      "tags": ["scheduling", "exercise_preference"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Conversation Flow Integration

### Memory Detection Flow
1. **User sends message** to AI coach
2. **Existing memories retrieved** for conversation context (limit: 10 most relevant)
3. **AI generates response** using existing memories in prompt
4. **Memory detection runs** on user's message (post-response)
5. **If memory detected** (>70% confidence): save memory + add confirmation
6. **Response delivered** to user with optional memory confirmation

### Prompt Integration Example
```
# USER MEMORIES
Based on previous conversations, here are important things the user has specifically asked you to remember:

## Preference Memories
### 1. I prefer morning workouts and like compound movements
- **Importance**: high
- **Usage**: Used 3 times (last: Jan 12, 2025)
- **Created**: Jan 10, 2025

## Goal Memories
### 1. I want to deadlift 400lbs by summer
- **Importance**: high
- **Usage**: Used 5 times (last: Jan 14, 2025)
- **Created**: Jan 8, 2025

**IMPORTANT**: Use these memories to personalize your coaching. When relevant memories apply to the current conversation, reference them naturally to show continuity and personalized care.
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Response Times
- **Memory Retrieval**: <50ms (DynamoDB query)
- **Memory Detection**: 200-500ms (Bedrock API call)
- **Memory Storage**: <100ms (DynamoDB write)
- **Total Overhead**: <650ms (mostly parallel operations)

### Cost Analysis
- **Detection Cost**: ~$0.001 per message with memory request
- **Storage Cost**: ~$0.000001 per memory per month
- **Retrieval Cost**: ~$0.0000001 per conversation
- **Overall Impact**: <1% of total conversation costs

### Scalability Metrics
- **Memory Limit**: 10 memories per conversation (performance optimization)
- **Storage Capacity**: Unlimited memories per user
- **Query Performance**: O(1) retrieval by user partition
- **Concurrent Handling**: Fully parallelizable operations

## User Experience Design

### Natural Language Interface
Users interact with memories through natural conversation:

**User**: "Remember that I have a bad lower back and should avoid heavy deadlifts"
**AI**: "✅ I've remembered that for you: 'has a bad lower back and should avoid heavy deadlifts'"

**Next Conversation**:
**User**: "What's a good leg workout for today?"
**AI**: "Given your lower back considerations that we've discussed, I'd recommend focusing on..."

### Memory Feedback
- **Immediate Confirmation**: "✅ I've remembered that for you: [content]"
- **Natural Integration**: AI references memories contextually in responses
- **No Explicit Listing**: Memories work behind the scenes unless directly asked

### Privacy Controls
- **Explicit Opt-in**: Only saves memories when explicitly requested
- **User Ownership**: All memories belong to the requesting user
- **Coach Scoping**: Memories can be coach-specific or global across coaches
- **Content Control**: Users control exactly what content is stored

## Quality Assurance

### Detection Accuracy
- **Conservative Threshold**: 70% confidence prevents false positives
- **Context Awareness**: Uses last 3 messages for better understanding
- **Type Classification**: AI determines appropriate memory type and importance
- **Validation**: Content extraction validated before storage

### Memory Management
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Similar memories for same user/coach filtered
- **Quality Control**: Minimum content length and relevance checks
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitors which memories are actually helpful
- **Cleanup Strategy**: Unused memories can be archived after extended periods

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Memory failures never interrupt conversations
- **Fallback Behavior**: Conversations continue normally if memory systems unavailable
- **Logging Strategy**: Comprehensive error logging for system monitoring
- **Recovery Patterns**: Automatic retry logic for transient failures

## Future Enhancements
